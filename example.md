How do I get back into the habit of publishing? You know how there's this analogy of going to the gym everyday for 5 minutes. And you'll form the habit and slowly start going for longer. That's something that I want to translate to writing / creating content. I had a streak going and that was a powerful motivator. But now that it's gone, I don't have the same energy. And it feels like the longer I take a break from things the better the post has to be when it's published. I'm 100% overthinking. Maybe the equivalent is starting with social media. Make a short form post or thread based on something you've been thinking about.

But I want to have good opinions put out there. Sometimes when I write, I get the first thing that comes out of my head. But when I read it over, I find that it's full of stuff I don't actually believe in. Or if I had just spent a little bit more time researching, I would've found out the difference almost immediately.

Maybe it doesn't even start with social media. Maybe it's just a micro blog post or newsletter that you send. That you also send on your social media page.

It's not that I don't want to publish. I do, but I feel like it needs to be really good. I have snippets of so many ideas that I don't know what to spend time on. And then when I do spend time on one idea, I eventually get to the point where I hate it. Is there a framework for writing and vetting ideas? I think zettelkasten is meant to help with that.

And maybe that's what I should be sharing. A single zettelkasten note that contains a single idea. Eventually, I can bundle up a few of them into a blog post. But as a way to build the muscle maybe it's about getting a single note published.

Having one big side project and lots of smaller ones on the go. What is the idea of finished? I feel like finished for me is to have something that somebody else can use. The smaller projects I don't think I care too much about that. So I'm not thinking about deployment or error handling. Just playing around with a program to see if I can get it to do something.

My decision making framework. When I have to decide on how a feature should look, what the design should be. I have a few heuristics in mind:
- If this is a side project, what would I learn the most from? What seems the most fun?
- If this is something I would show to someone else or to sell. I think more about the persona. What does my customer look like. How would they use the application?
- Think one more step as well. If I chose to do it this way, does it support change?
- Design twice philosophy.

**2025-06-24**
Design twice philosophy. Database design is a concrete example. The first idea is never the best one. What does it look like when I do design? Keep it scrappy. Pen and paper.

At this stage in my career, I want to make myself obsolete in some aspects. I want to make myself crucial in the aspects I care about. Too often I take on too much work and end up being on the hook for all of it. *Probably would word that last sentence a bit differently so I don't seem entitled.*

What do you do if you don’t have a mentor? Piece together information from people you follow and trust. Any behind the scenes stuff. Or podcasts on breaking down problems and thoughts.

For most of my career I didn't have a mentor. It's one thing that I would go back and change if I could. There's lots of things that I had to figure out by myself and it took way longer then I expected.

Current state of DevX is focused on how to get the most out of developers without spending more money. It's a shitty place to be. CEO's are justifying this trend with AI tooling.



Become proficient with AI is a CEO's justification for this trend.



Companies are frothing at the mouth to have devs use AI tooling to be more productive. But instead of replacing saved time with learning and development it's replaced by more feature work.




Current state of devx is a bit weird. It's no longer look at some metrics and perform some actions to change the metrics. It's very focused on how do I get the most out of developers without spending more money. Basically, companies won't have headcount but expect devs to perform more.

That's a shitty paradigm to be in. It gives devx teams more leverage. But it also causes much more stress. Are we focusing on the right goals? Is it truly to give devs back more time? It's almost like we can ignore the SPACE framework and laser focus on this one thing.
- Reduce local development issues.
- Alleviate any hard blockages.
- Find ways to use AI to take over some of the dev tasks. Like code reviews, writing PR descriptions, etc.
- What about testing?

What's the problem here? It's that devs aren't spending time learning and getting better. They're stuck in a loop of churning out work. Because their time will go straight back into project work. I fucking know it.

The current state of developer experience is weird. Every company is pushing for AI adoption without understanding the end goal. And companies want developers to do more with less resources. Think Shopify with their internal memo justifying why you should hire someone over using AI.

The shift is towards reducing dev hours spent on "non-fruitful" tasks. The tasks that AI is meant to take away. Things like generating PR descriptions, code reviews, writing code. And devs should have more time thinking, designing, or more realistically managing their AI agents. So DevX teams are thinking less about developer experience and satisfaction and more on how to save developers time.

Some could argue that saving developer time from doing the things they don't want will increase satisfaction. But I can see the extreme end. Where companies will continue to squeeze the most out of their devs. Pushing them constantly to release more features, faster.

And here's where the weirdness of DevX lies. As a devx team we need to show something to the company. We need to show that we're saving the company money either by enabling devs to move faster, reduce friction points, or to cut down on other costs. However, for the devs this goal is a little different. At least for me, I want dev satisfaction to be high. Because my gut feeling is that a happy dev willl result in a more innovative, higher performing, and less likely to churn dev.

So what do we do about the state of things?

I honestly don't know. And I'm pretty sure no company knows. Even the companies pushing AI don't even know what to measure. Because number of tabs accepted or number of requests is not it ([source](https://docs.cursor.com/account/teams/analytics)). I don't have a good answer here. Tech is always a pendulum. Right now it's swinging hard in one direction. We haven't hit that wall yet before it starts swinging back the other way. Unfortunately, I can see it being a painful journey until we see the pendulum swinging back.

The best teams will be the ones that embrace AI as part of developer satisfaction and not only developer productivity.

AI is like a senior developer who has zero context of the codebase or company. Like a brand new hire. But it's like that every time you talk to it. I think that's a better analogy then an intern

What are my thoughts on notetaking? I have quite a bit now. What about writing inbox? Is there something worth talking about?

Are my zettels just my content that I publish? Why have the distinction? A zettel should sit on its own. But I guess because it's a chain of thought it would be hard to track. But for blogs maybe that's good? An evergreen note should be long enough to have all the context but still have relations to other posts. So I'm not writing a true zettel. But something that is self contained for myself, but that is also published for others to see.

What is the right ratio between work, side projects (coding), writing, promoting, life things, health etc? I don't know yet. But I should probably have some idea of it and stick to it for a little bit to see how it goes. Doing more is not a very good answer.

What did I learn from the last 10 years of my career? What would I do differently?
- Get mentors earlier in my career. I made a lot of mistakes early on. It would've been nice to have a mentor to help me figure out what I want to do. I feel like I would've landed where I am now much faster.
- Take better notes and bring those notes from job to job. It felt like I was starting from scratch over and over.
- Get better at writing down what I did. Helps for future jobs, also performance reviews.
- Invest more time in my network - not too late.
- Show up consistently on side projects. I don't have to do a lot. But I should do something everyday to stay relevant.
	- If this is not something you want to do then I think the first 3 are super important.
- Get good at interviewing?
- Live below my means, kinda silly but especially now don't spend every dollar I earn. Invest money earlier.
- 10x my writing. It's more important to write documents then to code sometimes.

How do I find a mentor? What did I do instead?

How do I avoid burnout? It's much easier to prevent burnout then recover from it.
- Journalling helps. Try to catch signs early. Understand what makes me burnt out. Days of meetings makes me feel like I'm done.
- Finding purpose. If you have no autonomy or purpose then you'll be burnt out faster. Find the things you can control.
- Do things that recharge you. Generally it's the opposite of whatever makes me burnt out. Too many meetings one day? Then the next I'll carve some time to get in flow either coding or gaming.
- Keeping habits outside work. Sleeping, eating, exercising all huge.

How to communicate the why behind a project? I feel like developers do a lot of things by gut feeling. They say something is important but don't necessarily communicate why the thing is important. Gathering metrics is useful especially if you're trying to compare the impact of two different projects. But what about the projects that don't have any metrics associated with them? Or a project that is meant to gather those metrics? How do we justify these projects?

[Hanselminutes Technology Podcast - Fresh Air and Fresh Perspectives for Developers - Blogging for Developers with Mark Downie](https://hanselminutes.com/981/blogging-for-developers-with-mark-downie) The parts that stood out to me was who you're writing for. You're writing for yourself. Micro blogging? Owning all your content. Even if your blog post gets 3 views, that's 3 emails you don't have to send. Write for others. It makes me think that mentoring is useful here so I know what questions to answer.

How do we come up with writing ideas? It's part of answering questions. Either we talk to people in real life, or in communities, reddit, hackernews, bluesky. See what people are talking about. What are they writing about?

Only you have that unique perspective.

[How His $40K Side Hustle Became a Full-Time Career - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfD1-k-JmVg) I liked this podcast, some things that stood out to me were the skills needed to be a creator. Create educational content first to grow your user base. Then be more personal to keep the user base. He tried a bunch of things initially. I think a lot of it is consistency. Also he focuses on telling his own story. He finds the story in every content he shares and if he doesn't have a story then he doesn't tell the story.

Honestly, consistency is the one thing that I keep coming back to. That I don't seem to have!

Am I qualified to give career advice?

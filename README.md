# Spaced Repetition Writing Inbox

Use spaced reptition to help you write! Inspired by [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zSK4LyrCbG9zDrdCWmcovUW).

Create notes and thoughts that are added to a writing inbox. Review these notes daily marking them as fruitful or unfruitful. Fruitful posts you'll see more often and unfruitful ones you'll see less.
Once you no longer need a post you can archive it so it no longer appears in your review queue.
